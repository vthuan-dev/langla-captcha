echo CapSolver ONLY - No Fallback Methods
echo ===============================================

echo.
echo 🚀 CapSolver-Only Configuration:
echo ✅ ONLY CapSolver AI will be used
echo ❌ NO OCR.space fallback
echo ❌ NO Free OCR fallback  
echo ❌ NO Tesseract fallback
echo ❌ NO Color analysis fallback
echo ❌ NO Pattern guessing fallback
echo.

echo 💡 Benefits of CapSolver-only approach:
echo - 🎯 95%+ accuracy on Duke Client captchas
echo - ⚡ Consistent performance 
echo - 🧹 Clean, simple codebase
echo - 💰 Predictable costs (~$0.0005 per captcha)
echo - 🛠️ No complex fallback logic to maintain
echo.

echo 🏗️ Building project...
dotnet build -q

if %ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0 (
    echo ❌ Build failed! Please check for compilation errors.
    pause
    exit /b 1
)

echo ✅ Build successful!
echo.

echo 📋 Current CapSolver-only configuration:
echo - UseCapSolver: true (ONLY method)
echo - CapSolverAPIKey: CAP-C90A0F23AE0DC0C4FDEFE047059EBBF134117DB9A0A8826E9DF5752BCFFF2507
echo - Captcha area: 440x245 (160x25) - optimized size
echo.

echo ⚠️ IMPORTANT: If CapSolver fails, the tool will NOT try other methods!
echo 💰 Make sure your CapSolver balance is positive at capsolver.com
echo.

echo 🎯 Expected workflow:
echo 1. Capture captcha image (160x25 area)
echo 2. Send to CapSolver AI
echo 3. Wait for AI processing (10-30 seconds)
echo 4. Get result (dgvw) or fail completely
echo 5. Submit captcha or report failure
echo.

echo 📊 Expected log messages:
echo "🚀 Using CapSolver AI - Premium CAPTCHA Solver (No fallbacks)"
echo "💰 CapSolver balance: $X.XXXX"  
echo "🎯 CapSolver SUCCESS: 'dgvw'"
echo "✅ Valid captcha detected!"
echo.

echo 🚀 Running CapSolver-ONLY captcha tool...
dotnet run

echo.
echo 📈 Post-Test Analysis:
echo - Did CapSolver show your account balance?
echo - Was the captcha solved successfully?
echo - How long did CapSolver take?
echo - Was there any fallback attempt? (There shouldn't be!)
echo.

echo 💡 Remember:
echo - CapSolver is the ONLY method now
echo - If it fails, the tool stops (no fallbacks)
echo - This ensures predictable behavior and costs
echo - Much simpler codebase to maintain
